# üî• What's this?

A modified version of Terraria Overhaul that removes everything but the Smooth Camera functionality.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How do I build this?

Below is a step by step instruction for that. It only assumes that you know at least how to use command prompts, shells, or terminals. You should.

- Get [TModLoader from Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader).
- Get [Git from git-scm](https://git-scm.com/download). Most defaults suffice for installation.
- Clone the mod's 1.4 branch into `%userprofile%/Documents/My games/Terraria/tModLoader/ModSources`.
The git command for that would be `git clone https://github.com/glencoe2004/TerrariaOverhaul-SmoothCamera -b dev`, where `dev` is the branch you want to clone.
- Head over to Mod Sources in-game and `Build & Reload` TerrariaOverhaul.

That's all. Use `git fetch` and `git pull` to keep up with updates. Note that you'll need to rerun patching in the tML setup tool when updating tML.
